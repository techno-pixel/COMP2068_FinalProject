# COMP2068_FinalProject

My application is an AirBnB booking platform.

To use the application, you must first register, providing a name, email, email confirmation, password, and password confirmation.

Then you must proceed to login with the email and password you registered with. 

From there you will have access to browse the rooms, and view your profile.

I didn't get to finish, you can see in my controllers I was trying to create a schema and functions to fetch and get the ID created and then provide the name and email on profile, and maybe even add a page to edit. But I didn't have time amidst working full time and also all my other projects and finals (your final and another final on wednesday the 16th happen to also fall on my birthday) so it's all i could manage to do alone.

The booking button doesn't work fully, I was creating a bookingID as well to display as a reservation on the profile. 

Logout returns you to the home page, showing you restricted access and only showing home/login/register. I made it refresh as well and removes the token created to successfully logout.
